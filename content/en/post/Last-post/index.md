## What could this post be about.
According to the assignment, we were allowed to choose any topic for this post. This is a wonderful opportunity to share something really about yourself, and not about any boring things. And I would be happy to tell you, for example, about my favorite ‚ÄúPieces of Media,‚Äù as they say on the English-speaking Internet. That is, about your favorite games, books, movies, etc.. And believe me, I have something to talk about, just the story of the girl from the funny parody picture above! 

## But I won't. 
And it's not because I don't like to do it. On the contrary, talking about my favorite things is my favorite thing of all! 

## Then why?
I don't want. You're not interested. The task is completed, I'm calling it a day.
